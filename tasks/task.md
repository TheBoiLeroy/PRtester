# Task: Implement Array Products Function

## Description

Create a Python function called `calculate_products` that takes a list of integers and returns a new list where each element at index `i` is the product of all numbers in the original list **except** the one at `i`.

### Requirements

- Do **not** use division.
- The input list will contain at least two integers.
- The function should be efficient and handle large input lists.
- Include:
  - Function implementation
  - Example usage
  - Basic docstring
  - Any necessary imports
  - Type hints

### Example

```python
>>> calculate_products([1, 2, 3, 4])
[24, 12, 8, 6]
